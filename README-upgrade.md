## Upgrading SQLite

This document lists the steps needed to upgrade the sources in this repository
with the latest revision from upstream.

## Source Directory

The upgrade takes place on `aosp-main`. The primary directory is below.

```text
external/sqlite
```

The upgrade steps are:

*   Select a version for the upgrade.
*   Download the autoconf amalgamation tarball. For release 3.42.0, the URL is
    [sqlite-autoconf-3420000.tar.gz](https://sqlite.org/2023/sqlite-autoconf-3420000.tar.gz).
*   Change to the directory `external/sqlite` in the workspace.
*   Run the script `UPDATE-SOURCE.bash`. This script is executable. The single
    argument is the path to the tarball.
*   Update the internal bookkeeping files (see below).

`UPDATE-SOURCE.bash` may fail if the Android patch cannot be applied cleanly. If
this happens, correct the patch failures by hand and rebuild the Android patch
file. Use the script `REBUILD-ANDROID-PATCH.bash` to rebuild the patch file.
Then rerun `UPDATE-SOURCE.bash`. It is important that `UPDATE-SOURCE.bash` run
without errors.

A number of files in this directory require special handling.

### README.version

This contains the URL of the source code, the version information, and the bug
component under which the Android tree was updated. An example is below.

```text
URL: https://sqlite.org/2023/sqlite-autoconf-3420000.tar.gz
Version: 3.42.0
BugComponent: 24950
```

### METADATA

This file contains a security tag and a reference to the license file. The
format changes now and then; ensure that it is up to date.

### LICENSE

This file contains the license that allows Android to use the third-party
software. SQLite is unusual because it has no license: it is in the public
domain. The current file content is below.

```text
The author disclaims copyright to this source code.  In place of
a legal notice, here is a blessing:

   May you do good and not evil.
   May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
   May you share freely, never taking more than you give.
```

## CTS Version Test

There is a CTS test that verifies the SQLite version. This must be updated as
well and it must be updated within `aosp-main` at the same time as the source.

```text
cts/tests/tests/database/src/android/database/sqlite/cts/SQLiteDatabaseTest.java
```

Update the following two constants (the values below are for SQLite 3.42.0).

```java
    static final String EXPECTED_MAJOR_MINOR_VERSION = "3.42";
    static final int EXPECTED_MIN_PATCH_LEVEL = 0;
```

## Miscellaneous Files

The following files are updated in an internal Android branch (such as `main`)

### package.html

```text
frameworks/base/core/java/android/database/sqlite/package.html
```

This is a documentation file that, among other things, maps SQLite versions to
Android API levels. It should be updated every time SQLite is upgraded and on
every Android API bump. There is a small problem with API names: Android usually
prefers not to publicize the new API level until it is official, so care must be
taken not to expose unofficial API levels through this file.

The current plan for modifying this file when SQLite is upgraded is to add a new
row, using "latest" as the API level. The file should also be updated
appropriately when a new API level is formally announced.

This file probably should be modified in an Android branch (not AOSP). That way
it enters public view with the official release process.

## Recommended Tests

The following tests are recommended before committing an update:

```text
CtsScopedStorageDeviceOnlyTest
CtsScopedStorageBypassDatabaseOperationsTest
CtsScopedStorageGeneralTest
CtsScopedStorageRedactUriTest
CtsDatabaseTestCases
FrameworksCoreTests:android.database
```

At the time of writing, there are no test failures in the baseline code.
